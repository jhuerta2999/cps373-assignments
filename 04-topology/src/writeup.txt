The time lapsed in order for the routers to recieve their messages makes perfect sense

For the client to server network, all routers are able to send their messages to where
it shoudl be received at the same time. But becasue router 1 can only process messages
one at a time there it takes an extra milaseconds in order to proccess all four messages
that were recieved at the same time. All times from the client to the server takes 1000
ms + the extra time for the server to proccessall messages

The ring topology makes sense as well. The longest path or travel distance for a package is 
from r6 to r7. Thhat takes a total of 700 ms, but the end result is not 700 ms plus a couple 
more to process becasue there is a point in where the the messages are sent to a router at the 
same time, so we need to do 100 ms to send one message and another 100 ms for the other message.
This happens at r3. So we account the longest distance + the process time + the extra 100 ms for 
r3 sending two messages. Which gives us a total of a bit ocer 800ms

The complex network works runs into the same problem that occured in the ring topology. The longest
time needed is at least 2300 ms which is a message from r4 to r5. We can ignore r8 to r6 becasuse
this message transfer causes no problems becasue of how fast it is able to send its message. The 
complexity comes in with the other 2 messages. r4 can reach r1 in 1100 ms, but when that occurs r1 
would still be sending a message to r5 that takes 1200 ms. So becasue of this wait time we must account 
extra 100 ms. After that the proccess time for the message from r1 to r9 is proccessed durint the time
of the message being sent from r4 to r5, which is an 800 ms proccess vs a 1200 ms process. So we account
the longest time + plus the 100 ms overlap time + the extra process time, which gives us just above 2400 ms
